Purpose

Provide a structured site to study medical texts, organized into three levels: Department → Chapter → Section.

Allow users to quickly navigate from high-level lists to detailed section content (image-based text pages).

Keep the site responsive by only loading what is necessary when needed.

Scope

Hierarchical navigation (Department → Chapter → Section)

Section content display (images of text pages)

Bookmarks / favorites

Lightweight search (by Department, Chapter, Section name)

Minimal metadata display (last updated, source/reference)

Main Use Cases

User opens the list of Departments.

User clicks a Department → an accordion expands with its Chapters.

User clicks a Chapter → its Sections expand.

User clicks a Section → the section’s content (image) is displayed.

User can bookmark sections for later access.

User can use search to filter Departments/Chapters/Sections by name.

Content Model

Department

Name, order, optional description, updated date

Chapter

Parent department, name (e.g., “Chapter 1”), optional summary, order, updated date

Section

Parent chapter, name (e.g., “1-1 Glomerular Disease”), optional summary, order, reference to one or more images, updated date, source (optional)

Bookmark

Collection of Section IDs per user

Review Info (optional)

Labels or notes (e.g., “Reviewed”, “Draft”) attached to Departments or Chapters

Navigation Behavior

Initial screen: list of Departments.

Accordion expansion:

Clicking a Department expands its Chapters.

Clicking a Chapter expands its Sections.

Only one accordion open at a time at each level (default).

Breadcrumbs: Top > Department > Chapter (active).

URLs reflect the open state for sharing/bookmarking:

/department

/department/chapter

/department/chapter/section

Loading & Performance Strategy

Load content progressively:

On page load: only Department metadata.

On opening a Department: fetch Chapters for that Department.

On opening a Chapter: fetch Sections for that Chapter.

On opening a Section: fetch section content (images).

Cache loaded data for short-term reuse.

Lazy-load images only when the Section is opened or near the viewport.

Long lists should be broken into chunks (“load more”) to reduce scroll burden.

If loading fails, retry at the Department/Chapter/Section level independently.

UI Elements & States

Top bar: search field, bookmark button

Accordion items: normal, expanded, loading, error, bookmarked

Section viewer:

Image viewer with zoom, swipe (for multi-page), page number, loading indicator

Retry option if image fails to load

Search

Filters locally across Department/Chapter/Section names.

Results allow direct navigation to the corresponding item.

Section content itself (images) is not searchable.

Bookmarks

Bookmark/Unbookmark sections individually.

Dedicated bookmark view showing saved sections with parent info.

Offline storage when not logged in, synced to account if logged in.

Accessibility & Usability

Full keyboard navigation for expanding/collapsing and opening items.

Screen reader support with clear hierarchy labeling.

Images have simple alt text (e.g., “Section 1-1 Glomerular Disease, page 1”).

Loading/error states always visible and textual.

Non-Functional Requirements

Initial load must be lightweight (Departments only).

List expansion should respond within ~1 second.

Section image loading should show progressive feedback.

Mobile-first layout with large tap targets.

Data loads are on-demand only (no unnecessary preloading).

Independent recovery: one failed section load does not break the whole page.

Content Management

Content structured as Department → Chapter → Section.

Updates happen at Section level (image replacements/additions).

Each Section has persistent IDs for future redirects (if merged/renamed).

Metadata includes last updated date and optional reviewer name.

Quality & Consistency

Naming conventions defined (e.g., number + hyphen format, consistent full/half-width use).

Badges for status: “Reviewed”, “In Revision”, “Archived”.

References or sources displayed at Section bottom.

Error Handling

Network issue: show retry on the affected item.

Access restriction (future feature): lock icon with reason.

Data issue: show “Coming Soon” instead of breaking the page.

Analytics (Optional)

Track navigation funnel (Department → Chapter → Section).

Track completion of Section views.

Track search terms and bookmark usage.

Highlight popular Sections to users.

👉 The key design points:

Progressive loading (never fetch all at once)

Accordion-based navigation with URL support for deep links

Independent retry per item to avoid full reload
